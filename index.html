<h2>The Studio</h2>

  <div class='col col-left'>
    <p>
      Renovated less than a year ago, it has a brand new kitchen with quartz countertops and Bosch dishwasher, a brand new bathroom with custom shower and heat fan, and a wall-mounted A/C &amp; heating unit. The apartment comes partially furnished with a couch, pantry unit and murphy bed, so you don't need to move large pieces up the stairs. Just bring your clothes and kitchen gear! The microwave and toaster oven are also included as they are specifically sized for their space in the kitchen. It also includes some smaller items (small bookshelves, stools, chairs) that can stay or go as you like.
