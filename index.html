<h1>16 Henchman St, North End, Boston</h1>

<p class='intro'>
     Our 304sq.ft studio right in a quiet part of the North End is perfect for anyone looking for a tiny home experience in the heart of Boston. It's walking distance from tons of awesome restaurants, bars and the green and orange lines. On the 5th floor of a walk-up, it includes a private deck that adds an extra 300sq. ft of outdoor living space.

    <h2>The Studio</h2>
    <p>
      Renovated less than a year ago, it has a brand new kitchen with quartz countertops and Bosch dishwasher, a brand new bathroom with custom shower and heat fan, and a wall-mounted A/C &amp; heating unit. The apartment comes partially furnished with a couch, pantry unit and murphy bed, so you don't need to move large pieces up the stairs. Just bring your clothes and kitchen gear! The microwave and toaster oven are also included as they are exactly sized of their space in the kitchen. It also includes some smaller items (small bookshelves, stools, chairs) that can stay or go as you like.
